        "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to understand the characteristics of the dataset, identify patterns, and preprocess the data. This involves handling missing values, detecting outliers, and visualizing relationships between features.\n",

        "Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for training by encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.\n",

        "Model Selection: Choose a regression algorithm suitable for the task. Common choices include linear regression, decision tree regression, or ensemble methods like random forests.\n",

        "Model Training: Train the selected model using the labeled training data, allowing the algorithm to learn the relationships between the input features and the target variable (car sales price).\n",
        "\n",
        "Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset to assess its ability to generalize to new, unseen data. Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) may be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance and generalization ability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prediction: Deploy the trained model to predict the sale prices of new cars based on their features.\n",
